In this technical introduction to Ark, we will outline one by one the basic concepts that make up the Ark protocol.

On the [homepage](/), you can find a high-level overview of Ark's functionality and interactions, but in here we will try to go a little more in-depth on the technical details of how these concepts actually work.

A quick outline of the different aspects:

- [What are VTXOs?](vtxos)
- [How do connectors work?](connectors)
- [Out-of-Round payments (Arkoor)](oor)
- [Covenant-less Ark (clArk)](clark)
